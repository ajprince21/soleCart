Sole Cart is a mobile shopping application that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase footwear products with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Step 1: Install Package Dependencies

Before you can start your React Native project, you need to install its package dependencies. To do this, open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project:

```bash
cd path/to/your/react-native/project


## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

 Now, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
